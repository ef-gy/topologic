###- INSTALLATION -###########################################################

You'll need to have libxml2 with development files and a recent version of
clang++ available on your system.

Furhermore, you'll need a recent version of libefgy - a header-only C++
template library for maths. If you don't want to install the library
system-wide, you could instead just create a symlink at include/ef.gy that
would point to the directory of the same name in libefgy's sources.

To compile the binary, run:

$ make

To install the programme, run:

# make PREFIX=/usr install

Adjust PREFIX as appropriate.
